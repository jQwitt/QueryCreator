Purpose: 
    This is a simple php site to interface with my local backend database

Environment:

Limitations:
    1.) Toggling a backend connection requires a large amount of resources
        and is thus impractical, but I chose to implement this as a challenge
        to myself. 
            - storing all of my connection variables in the session, as well as
            the connection itself is VERY impractical, as it uses far too many resources.  
    2.) Ggogle is slated to update is cross-site cookie policy early next year so the 
        font awesome cdn might possibly be impacted unless they update their services
Expansion: 
    1.) connection variables could be custom fields given by the user and passed
        to the connect.php file
            - these custom variables could potentially be stored in a cookie 

Notes: 
    1.) log export functionality based on approach by Carlos Delgado with ourcodeworld.com
